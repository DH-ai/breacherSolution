# PolyPrimes

## Author: Harsh Suthar

Introducing the ground breaking encryption using Polynomials and bases, now you can generate completely random primes within milliseconds and achieve a safe and secure encyption. Using polynomial equations and bases, we must have set a new standard for encryption, or have we?

P.S. It might be helpful to set up "SageMath" to leverage its useful functions, which could come in handy.
