# Zngelbfuxn

## Author: Mohana Evuri

Find the flag through the shell!

To get the shell:

```bash
docker run --interactive --tty --platform linux/amd64 --rm --hostname pseudo mohanaevuri/zngelbfuxn:latest
```

For **ARM Mac** users, please install **Rosetta 2 - (hard to uninstall)**, which supports emulation.
Apart from this, we are expecting you to have **Docker** installed.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> We are expecting a **PROPER Writeup** for this challenge, getting the flag **ONLY THROUGH THE SHELL**. Expect this to be a challenge hosted on a server and that you can access only the shell.
