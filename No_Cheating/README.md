Agent!

We have a new case for you! One of our undercover field agents sent out a distress call from the lair of the evil Money Games Co. LTD headquarters

Fearing that the cover had been blown, the agent transferred the encrypted files of all the shady operations of Money Games Co. ltd. However, unable to safely transmit the code to unlock it, the agent instead hid the key in a very-poorly-made-but-passable game and published it under the Money Games Co. ltd name.

We have isolated the game but we do not know how the agent has hidden the key.

We require your assistance!
Find the key! It is of utmost importance!

One last thing... the agent managed to inform us that Money Games Co. ltd caught wind of the plot and used encryptions in their games (Although not very well, they're very lazy according to our reports).

Fortunately, our Agent sent us the encryption function and, on top of it, used the same encryption function to hide the key!
