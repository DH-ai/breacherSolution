Only the admin knows the secret to the flag. Think you’ve got what it takes to mirror the situation, and claim the admin’s secret?

> [!CAUTION]
> One can easily see the flag or admin password in the disassembled binary. Treat this like a server hosted challenge where the actual flag and admin password are different.
> This challenge requires you to submit either a solve script or a payload to get the flag without directly using the admin password found out by disassembling.
